i am a behavioral ecologist interested in how <span style="color: #8A6A95; font-weight: bold;">**death**</span> and <span style="color: #8A6A95; font-weight: bold; ">**loss**</span> in social groups can inform what we know about <span style="color: #8A6A95; font-weight: bold; ">**social bonds**</span> in nonhuman species. 

right now you can find me working on my phd at the george washington primate behavioral ecology lab in washington, dc and in the field at gombe national park, tanzania. my work is funded by the national science foundation, the leakey foundation, american society of mammalogists, and gw anthropology department.

my recent projects explore the influence on friendship on space use in wild primates analyzing geospatial and behavioral data from the world's longest running great ape dataset

before my phd, i worked with the indiana department of natural resources herpetology and nongame mammals teams surveying indiana's endangered reptile and mammal species.
