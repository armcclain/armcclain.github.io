       i am a behavioral ecologist interested in how death and loss in social groups can inform what we know about social bonds in nonhuman species. 

    right now you can find me working on my phd at the george washington university <a href="https://cashp.columbian.gwu.edu/primate-behavioral-ecology" style="color: #840032;">**primate behavioral ecology lab**</a> in washington, dc and in the field at <a href="https://janegoodall.ca/what-we-do/africa-programs/gombe-stream-research-centre/" style="color: #840032;">**gombe national park**</a>, tanzania. my work is funded by the national science foundation, the leakey foundation, the american society of mammalogists, and the gw anthropology department.  

    my recent projects explore the influence of friendship on space use in wild primates analyzing geospatial and behavioral data from the world's longest running great ape dataset.

    before my phd, i worked with the indiana department of natural resources herpetology and nongame mammals teams surveying indiana's endangered reptile and mammal species.
